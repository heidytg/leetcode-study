# leetcode-study

Solutions to LeetCode problems in Python, Go, TypeScript (and optionally Kotlin),
organized by problem. Each problem carries a single language-agnostic `tests.json`
fixture (the inputs/expected outputs from the LeetCode statement). **One shared runner
per language auto-discovers every problem and runs its solution against that fixture —
so adding a problem means writing only solution code, not new test files.**

## Layout

```
problems/
├── all.test.ts            # ONE vitest runner: discovers every tests.json + solution.ts
├── test_all.py            # ONE pytest runner: same, for Python
└── NNNN-slug/
    ├── README.md          # statement, signature, approach, Big-O, pattern, interview notes
    ├── tests.json         # shared cases: { function, compare, cases: [{ args, expected }] }
    ├── python/solution.py
    ├── go/                # solution.go + a 4-line solution_test.go that registers the fn
    ├── typescript/solution.ts
    └── kotlin/            # optional (needs Gradle/JUnit)
harness/                   # Go reflection-based shared test harness (RunFixture)
```

How each language avoids per-problem test boilerplate:

- **TypeScript / Python** — the single runner globs `problems/*/tests.json`, loads the
  sibling solution, and runs every case. No per-problem test file at all.
- **Go** — can't auto-discover unexported functions across packages, so each problem
  keeps a 4-line `solution_test.go` that hands its function(s) to `harness.RunFixture`,
  which decodes args by the function's signature via reflection. The scaffold generates
  this file, so you never hand-write it.

## Setup (fresh environment)

Each language is independent — install only the ones you want to run. The repo needs
**Node** (for the TypeScript runner *and* the scaffold/check scripts), and optionally
**Go** and **Python**.

### 1. Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/heidytg/leetcode-study.git
cd leetcode-study
```

### 2. Node.js ≥ 18 (required — scaffold, check, and TS tests)

- **Recommended:** a version manager — [`fnm`](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) or
  [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). With fnm: `fnm install 22 && fnm use 22`.
- **Or** download an LTS installer from <https://nodejs.org>.
- Then install dev dependencies (TypeScript + vitest):

```bash
npm install
node --version   # verify (want v18+; this repo was built on v22)
```

### 3. Go ≥ 1.22 (optional)

- Install from <https://go.dev/dl> (or `winget install GoLang.Go` on Windows,
  `brew install go` on macOS). No third-party modules are needed — the test harness
  (`harness/`) uses only the standard library.

```bash
go version
go test ./...    # runs every Go solution against its tests.json
```

### 4. Python ≥ 3.10 (optional)

- Install from <https://python.org> (or `brew install python`, `apt install python3`).
- Install the one test dependency:

```bash
pip install pytest
python --version
pytest problems  # runs every Python solution against its tests.json
```

> **Windows gotcha:** the built-in `python` / `python3` commands may be *App Execution
> Aliases* that just open the Microsoft Store instead of running Python. If
> `python --version` opens the Store or errors, either install real Python from
> python.org and re-open the terminal, or turn the aliases off under
> *Settings → Apps → Advanced app settings → App execution aliases*. After installing,
> use `py` (the Python launcher) if `python` still isn't found.

### 5. Verify the whole setup

```bash
npm test                       # all TypeScript solutions
go test ./...                  # all Go solutions (if Go installed)
pytest problems                # all Python solutions (if Python installed)
npm run check -- 0001-two-sum  # one problem across every installed language
```

## Commands

### Scaffold a new problem

```bash
# Creates problems/NNNN-slug/ with stubs from templates/
npm run new -- 167 two-sum-ii --fn twoSum --title "Two Sum II" --langs py,go,ts
```

### Run a problem's solutions against its tests.json

`npm run check` runs each language's tests for one problem and prints a per-language
pass/fail summary. Languages whose folder is absent are skipped automatically.

```bash
npm run check -- 0001-two-sum                 # all languages present
npm run check -- 0001-two-sum --langs py,ts   # only a subset
```

### Run a single language directly

The TS/Python runners cover all problems; filter to one by its slug. Go runs per
package.

```bash
# TypeScript (vitest) — filter by the problem slug (the describe name)
npx vitest run -t 0001-two-sum

# Python (pytest) — filter by the problem slug
pytest problems -k 0001-two-sum

# Go (go test) — needs Go installed
go test ./problems/0001-two-sum/go/...
go test ./problems/0001-two-sum/go/... -v
```

### Run everything

```bash
npm test            # every problem, TypeScript (problems/all.test.ts)
pytest problems     # every problem, Python (problems/test_all.py)
go test ./...       # every problem, Go (per-package + harness/)
```

## tests.json format

```json
{
  "function": "twoSum",
  "compare": "exact",
  "cases": [
    { "args": [[2, 7, 11, 15], 9], "expected": [0, 1] }
  ]
}
```

- `args` — positional arguments, applied in order to the solution function.
- `compare` — `"exact"` (default), `"sorted"`/`"set"` for order-independent output
  (compared via a recursive canonical sort), or `"roundtrip"` for codec problems that
  expose `encode`/`decode` (checks `decode(encode(x)) == expected`).
- The function's parameter/return **types** aren't in the JSON; Python/TS read them
  dynamically, and the Go harness decodes args via reflection from the registered
  function's signature.
- **Design problems** (e.g. Min Stack) keep the same fixture shape: the solution exposes
  the class *plus* a thin driver function (e.g. `minStackOps(ops, args)`) that replays
  LeetCode's `[operations]` / `[arguments]` lists and returns the per-op outputs (`null`
  for void ops). `function` points at the driver — no harness special-casing needed.
